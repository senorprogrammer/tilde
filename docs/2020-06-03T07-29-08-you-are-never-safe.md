# You Are Never Safe

'It is easy - maybe too easy - to stop asking yourself what would make you happy, and stay close to the things that you think will make you safe. This is wrong, and I will tell you why: you are never safe. Loss and change are constants. You will never be safe, and you may not always be happy - but you owe it to yourself to start asking the question.'

- Sady Doyle
