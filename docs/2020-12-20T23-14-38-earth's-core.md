# Earth's Core

Temperatures in Earth’s center, 4,000 miles below the surface, exceed those of the surface of the sun (6,000°C or 10,800°F)

The temperature in the photosphere is about 10,000 degrees F (5,500 degrees C).

The chromosphere, the next layer of the sun's atmosphere is a bit cooler — about 7,800 degrees F (4,320 degrees C).
