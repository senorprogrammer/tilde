# Autogolpe

A self-coup, or autocoup (from the Spanish autogolpe), is a form of putsch or coup d'Ã©tat in which a nation's leader, despite having come to power through legal means, dissolves or renders powerless the national legislature and unlawfully assumes extraordinary powers not granted under normal circumstances. Other measures taken may include annulling the nation's constitution, suspending civil courts and having the head of government assume dictatorial powers.
